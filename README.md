# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This projects presents a full machine learning pipeline to create a simple model(s) for customer churn prediction on [Kaggle's data](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers?select=BankChurners.csv). In particular, below steps are included:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training
4. Prediction
5. Model Evaluation

The code is designed not to produce a complex solution but rather to resemble best practices from production level environment with coding standards following the PEP 8 guidelines, tests written for each function and clear log file for info and errors.
